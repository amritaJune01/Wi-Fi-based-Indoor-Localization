# Wi-Fi-based-Indoor-Localization

The aim of this project is to develop a system that can accurately determine the room level location of a person within an indoor environment using WiFi signals. This can be achieved by utilizing the strength and quality of WiFi signals received by multiple access points (APs) installed in the indoor space.

This system has various potential applications, such as:
1. Locating faculty members and peers
2. Wi-Fi-supported Asset Tracking
3. Security and Surveillance

A few of the other features provided are:
1. Secure login and authentication using firebase
2. Real-time location tracking
3. User enabled location sharing
4. Last known location
5. A user friendly UI

Overall, this project has the potential to provide a reliable and cost-effective solution for indoor localization using WiFi signals.
